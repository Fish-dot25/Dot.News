<li><h2>New code in the Human Genome found:</h2>
<p> Scientists found a "hidden code" in the human genome, showing that orders that were ignored before as "junk DNA" are actually a code with uses and play an important role in gene controllment. This newly determined code, first found within transposable elements (TEs), which are DNA orders that can move from one location to another in a genome, acts as adjustment switches, controlling how genes are shown, especially during early human development. </p></li>
