<li><h2>New code in the Human Genome(DNA) found</h2>
<p> Scientists found a "hidden code" in the human genome, showing that orders that were ignored before as "junk DNA" are actually a code with uses and play an important role in gene controllment. This newly determined code, first found within transposable elements (TEs), which are DNA orders that can move from one location to another in a genome, acts as adjustment switches, controlling how genes are shown, especially during early human development. </p></li>
<li><h2> Eco-friendly plastic?!</h2>
<p>Yes, it's true. It sounds too good but it's true. Several eco-friendly, biodegradable (dissolvable) plastics have emerged, including those that dissolve in seawater and even deep-sea environments. One noticable example is LAHB, a lactate-based polyester that breaks down in deep-sea conditions,like water pressure, which are usually hard for plastic degradation. Additionally, research continues on PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoates), a bioplastic known for its biodegradability and potential for lower emissions.</p> </li>
<li><h2> NASA robots searching for life</h2>
NASA developed robotic technologies to explore the icy moons of Jupiter and Saturn, like Europa and Enceladus, and search for signs of life. A key concept involves small, auto swimming robots, like those in the SWIM project, that would be deployed into subsurface oceans after being delivered by a cryobot (an ice-melting probe). These robots would search for chemical and temperature signatures indicative of habitability or life. This made NASA launch Europa Clipper mission to explore Jupiter's icy moon Europa, which is considered a main location to search for signs of extraterrestrial(Not earth) life. The mission's main goal is to investigate whether the conditions on Europa could support life. </li>
